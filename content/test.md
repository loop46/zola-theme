# JustCash App

Truly private peer to peer payments. Because it isn't your bosses' business
when you pay for mimosas at brunch with the girls.

## There is only private mode

It isn't our business how you spend your money either. That's why JustCash
keeps your payments completely private, even from us. Think of us like a
digital ATM. We can see your withdrawals and deposits of JustCash, but
who you pay or who pays you in JustCash is between you and God.

## We can't snitch

You don't have to trust that we won't spill the beans if we are offered
millions of dollars to sell your information. We use fancy quantum
resistant cryptography and zero knowledge proofs so we can't tell who
is sending or receiving JustCash even if we wanted to.

## Is JustCash Crypto?

Absolutely not. JustCash is not a currency. JustCash does not use "block
chain" technologies or mining. Crypto currencies are terrible for the
environment and we recommend against using them.

The "just" in JustCash also stands for environmental justice.

## Is this for criminals?

No. We fully comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and know your
customer laws. JustCash really is no more easy for criminals to abuse than
just cash. Just like a bank we report any suspicious transactions or
patterns of spending or buying. And to create new JustCash you need a
regular bank account that also does all these reports.

But just like a regular bank account, until you deposit the cash we cannot
track what you are doing with it.

JustCash really is just like cash.

## What is Loop46?
